            The Ramayana, an ancient Indian epic, unfolds the divine saga of Lord Rama, his beloved wife Sita, and his
            devoted ally Hanuman, amidst a cosmic battle between good and evil. The story begins with the birth of Rama,
            the eldest prince of Ayodhya, and follows his journey from princely heir to exiled wanderer, to triumphant
            hero and righteous king.

            At the heart of the Ramayana is the abduction of Sita by the demon king Ravana, setting in motion a series
            of events that test the characters' virtues and resolve. Rama, accompanied by his loyal brother Lakshmana
            and the wise sage Vishwamitra, embarks on a quest to protect the sages and vanquish the demon horde
            troubling the land. Along the way, he encounters and defeats powerful adversaries, including the demoness
            Tataka and the demon king Maricha.

            During their exile in the forest, Sita is tricked by Ravana disguised as a golden deer and is subsequently
            abducted. Rama's anguish at the loss of his beloved drives him to form alliances with the Vanara (monkey)
            king Sugriva and his devoted general Hanuman. With the help of Hanuman and his army of monkeys, Rama crosses
            the vast ocean to Lanka, the stronghold of Ravana, to rescue Sita.

            The climax of the epic unfolds in a dramatic battle between the forces of good and evil. Rama, aided by his
            divine weapons and the unwavering support of his allies, confronts Ravana in a fierce duel. After a grueling
            fight, Rama emerges victorious, slaying Ravana and liberating Sita from captivity. However, Sita's purity
            and fidelity are questioned by the people of Ayodhya, leading Rama to reluctantly exile her to the forest.

            Despite his love for Sita, Rama feels bound by his duty as a king to uphold societal norms. Sita seeks
            refuge in the hermitage of the sage Valmiki, where she gives birth to Rama's twin sons, Lava and Kusha. The
            brothers grow up in the forest, unaware of their royal lineage, until fate reunites them with their father
            during a grand Ashwamedha (horse sacrifice) ceremony organized by Rama.

            Ultimately, the Ramayana culminates in Rama's triumphant return to Ayodhya, where he is crowned as the
            rightful king, and Sita is vindicated of all doubts through a trial by fire. The epic concludes with Rama's
            reign ushering in an era of peace, prosperity, and righteousness, symbolizing the victory of dharma over
            adharma and the triumph of virtue over vice. Through its timeless narrative, the Ramayana continues to
            inspire millions, offering invaluable lessons in devotion, duty, sacrifice, and the eternal quest for truth
            and righteousness.

                  Rama's father is King Dasaratha, a prince of the solar race,
                  and his mother is Queen Kausalya. Rama was born at the end
                  of the Second Age or Treta-yuga and he came into the world
                  specifically at the bidding of the gods to deal with the
                  fearsome multi-headed demon Ravana, the king of Lanka
                  (modern Sri Lanka). The great god Vishnu answered the gods'
                  call and appeared in a sacrificial fire made by Dasaratha.
                  The pious king was presented with a pot of nectar, and he
                  gave half of it to Kausalya who produced half-divine Rama as
                  a consequence. Rama had three half-brothers – Bharata,
                  Lakshmana, and Shatrughna - all with some, albeit lesser,
                  divine qualities. Rama's favourite brother and great
                  companion was Laksmana, son of Sumitra, while his loyal
                  servant was the monkey warrior Hanuman (or Hanumat).

                <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: white">
                  Rama's first adventure occurred when the sage Visvamitra
                  asked for help in fighting a demon or raksasa. Rama and
                  Laksmana, leaving their childhood home at Ayodhya capital of
                  the northern kingdom of Koshala, followed Visvamitra to his
                  home and there killed Taraka, a terrible female demon. In
                  gratitude Rama was given divine weapons, and he set off for
                  more adventures, ending up in Mithila. There Janaka the king
                  of Videha hosted our hero, and he met the king's beautiful
                  daughter Sita (also called Janaki or Maithili). The king had
                  promised the princess in marriage to anyone who could manage
                  to bend a huge bow which had once been the weapon of the
                  great god Shiva. Rama, with his divine strength, did more
                  than just bend the bow but broke it in half and so won the
                  hand of Sita, his first and most revered wife.

                <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: white">
                  Rama's succession to the throne of Ayodhya was made
                  difficult by his mother's hunchback slave Manthara. Jealous
                  of Rama, she soured the opinion of Kaikeyi, Dasaratha's
                  second wife, and convinced her to persuade her husband to
                  instead make Bharata heir to the throne. On top of this
                  slight Rama was exiled from the kingdom for fourteen years.
                  So, accompanied by Sita and his ever faithful companion
                  Laksmana, Rama went to live in the far south in Citrakuta,
                  deep in the Dandaka forest. Meanwhile, Dasaratha died, but
                  Bharata, seeing the injustice of Rama's treatment, decided
                  not to become king but instead to search for and return Rama
                  to his rightful home and birthright. When the two brothers
                  met once again, Rama obstinately refused to return to
                  Ayodhya until he had fulfilled his father's wishes and
                  served out his fourteen years of exile. After much
                  discussion, Bharata agreed to act as regent until that time,
                  and to prove to his subjects Rama's decision, he took his
                  brother's shoes as a symbol of Rama's royal status.

                  Rama did not stay still in the remainder of his exile but
                  visited many sages. Eventually, he ended up at Pancavati
                  along the river Godavari, an area plagued by demons. One in
                  particular, Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, fell in love
                  with Rama, and when her advances were resisted, she attacked
                  Sita in revenge. Laksmana was the first to react and cut off
                  the ears and nose of Surpanakha. Not best pleased with this
                  treatment, the enraged demoness gathered an army of demons
                  to attack the trio. In an epic battle Rama defeated them
                  all; however, Surpanakha was not finished with the matter
                  and she persuaded Ravana that Sita was a girl worth fighting
                  for. Accordingly, the demon king sought out Rama's home, and
                  while Rama was distracted in the hunt for a deer (who was
                  actually Ravana's magician Maricha in disguise), abducted
                  Sita, taking her back to Lanka in his aerial chariot to be
                  kept captive in his beautiful Ashoka garden.

                  Rama remains a figure of worship across India and South-east
                  Asia but especially in Oude and Bihar. He has, for example,
                  a magnificent temple at Ramesvaram, notable for its 17th
                  century CE columned corridor. In addition, the Ramanandis
                  are the largest and perhaps strictest Vaishnava monastic
                  order. Rama is also considered by some Buddhists to be an
                  avatar of Buddha, and sculptures of the hero sometimes
                  appears on the exterior of Buddhist temples. In art Rama is
                  always youthful and typically has green or blue skin, holds
                  a bow and arrows, and wears a yellow robe. He is most often
                  seen with Sita, Laksmana, and Hanuman – collectively known
                  as Rama's family or Rama Parivara. Episodes from the
                  Ramayana are especially popular in Hindu sculpture, wall
                  paintings, and art in general, most of all forest scenes
                  with Rama hunting the deer and the epic battle with Ravana.

                  Ravana is the mythical multi-headed demon-king of Lanka in Hindu mythology. With ten heads and twenty
                  arms, Ravana could change into any form he wished. Representing the very essence of evil, he famously
                  fought and ultimately lost a series of epic battles against the hero Rama, seventh avatar of Vishnu.

                  Ravana was a terrible demon (raksasa) who was the king of all demons and of the fortress island of
                  Lanka (modern-day Sri Lanka). His father was Visravas (son of Pulastya, one of the creator Prajapati)
                  and his mother Nikasa, also a demon and mother of the cannibal demons, the Pisitasanas. Ravana
                  acquired his throne through foul means when he expelled his half-brother Kubera, god of wealth, from
                  the island. Ravana had many sons, notably Aksa, who had three heads, symbolic of the three stages of
                  fever (heat, cold, and sweating), and Indrajit (aka Meghanada), who could make himself invisible.

                <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: white">
                  The Ramayana is the oldest Sanskrit epic and was written sometime in the 5th century BCE, with some
                  later additions. Ravana's name is explained, therein, in a colourful myth where the demon-king
                  challenges Nandisa (actually the great god Shiva and also known as Nandisvara) and comes off worse.
                  According to the story, one day Ravana met a dark dwarf with a monkey face while he was passing
                  through the mountains of Saravana. The dwarf would not let Ravana pass because his master Shiva was
                  busy hunting there and was not to be disturbed. Ravana questioned who this Shiva was and shook the
                  mountain in rage. This disturbed Shiva and his wife Parvati; the latter trembled with fear as they sat
                  upon the shaking peak, but Shiva calmly placed his toe upon the ground and the whole mountain fell on
                  top of Ravana's many arms. The demon let out such a shuddering cry of pain that Shiva named the demon
                  Ravana after his cry (rava). Ravana was only released from his predicament after 1,000 years of
                  pleading to the great god.

                  The Ramayana is really concerned with the story of the semi-divine Lord Rama, believed by many Hindus
                  to be based on a historical figure. He is perhaps the most virtuous figure in all of Hindu mythology.
                  His adventures illustrate above all the importance and rewards of fulfilling one's pious duty or
                  dharma, and he had been born for one specific task – to answer the call of the gods and kill the
                  fearsome multi-headed demon Ravana, terror of the earth.
                  Rama's troubles began when he was exiled from his father's kingdom, a victim of a conspiracy concocted
                  by his mother's jealous hunchback slave, Manthara. On top of that, his brother Bharata was made heir
                  in Rama's place. For 14 years, Rama had to wander the earth, visit sages, and wait to fulfil his
                  destiny.
                  Rama, his wife Sita, and great friend Laksmana one day eventually ended up at Pancavati along the
                  river Godavari, an area plagued by demons. One in particular, Surpanakha, the sister of Ravana, fell
                  in love with Rama, and when her advances were resisted, she attacked Sita in revenge. Laksmana was the
                  first to react and cut off the ears and nose of Surpanakha. Not best pleased with this treatment, the
                  enraged demoness gathered an army of demons to attack the trio. In an epic battle, Rama defeated them
                  all; however, Surpanakha was not finished with the matter, and she persuaded Ravana that Sita was a
                  girl worth fighting for. Accordingly, the demon king sought out Rama's home, and while Rama was
                  distracted in the hunt for a deer (who was actually Ravana's magician Maricha in disguise), abducted
                  Sita, taking her back to Lanka in his aerial chariot to be kept captive in the beautiful Ashoka garden
                  of his palace.

                <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: white">
                  Ravana is usually depicted as multi-headed and multi-armed, carrying all manner of lethal weapons. He
                  appears in the decorative sculpture of Hindu temples, most often in battle scenes with Rama or riding
                  his winged chariot. In a celebrated relief scene on the 8th-century CE Kailasanatha temple at Ellora,
                  Ravana is shown shaking the sacred Kailasa mountain (as in the Nandisa story) on which sit Shiva and
                  Parvati. Unusually, Ravana is carved completely in the round. Scenes from the Ramayana involving
                  Ravana were also very popular from the 16th century CE in Indian watercolours, especially esteemed are
                  those from Udaipur and the Pahari paintings.
