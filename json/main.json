With a thunderous roar, he enlarged his body to an immense size, his presence commanding awe and reverence. With a mighty kick, Hanuman launched himself into the air, soaring through the sky like a celestial bird. The birds of the mountain, inspired by his valor, accompanied him in a grand procession, their wings beating in unison. As Hanuman disappeared into the distance, the leaves and flowers that adorned his body fluttered down into the ocean, creating a breathtaking spectacle."
